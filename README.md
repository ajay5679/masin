This project dashboard was for free and open-source to use (core-ui react.js), I have used the dashboard and implemented my own code of react.js and also deleted some of the file to improve performance optimization. The dashboard can have multiple files upload at once and max upto 5 files in once. One can preview the file, delete the file. The file will be uploaded pretty fast and a toast on the top right will appear.
